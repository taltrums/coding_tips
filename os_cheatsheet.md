[Operating Systems in Three Easy Pieces]

**Chapter 1: Introduction**
- Introduction to Operating Systems: Operating systems are software that manage computer hardware and software resources and provide services to applications.
- Kernel Space vs. User Space: Kernel space is the protected part of the operating system where privileged operations and critical functions are executed. User space is where user applications and less critical tasks run.
- Components of an Operating System: Operating systems consist of four main components: processes, memory management, storage management, and I/O handling.

1. Operating Systems:
- Software that manages computer resources and provides services to applications.

2. Kernel Space vs. User Space:
- Kernel Space: Protected part of the operating system for privileged operations and critical functions.
- User Space: Area where user applications and less critical tasks run.

3. Components of an Operating System:
- Processes: Executing programs with their own memory space.
- Memory Management: Allocating and managing memory resources.
- Storage Management: Organizing and managing storage devices and file systems.
- I/O Handling: Managing input and output operations with devices.

**Chapter 2: Processes**
- Process Definition: A process is an executing program with its own memory space and resources. It represents an instance of a running program.
- Process States: Processes can be in different states, including running, ready, waiting, and terminated, based on their execution status and resource availability.
- Context Switching: Context switching is the mechanism of saving the current state of a process and restoring the saved state of another process for seamless execution.
- Process Creation and Termination: New processes can be created using system calls like fork() or exec(). Processes can terminate voluntarily or due to errors or completion of execution.
- Process Scheduling: Process scheduling algorithms determine the order in which processes are allocated CPU time.

1. Process Definition:
- An executing program with its own memory space and resources.

2. Process States:
- Running: Currently executing on the CPU.
- Ready: Waiting to be assigned CPU time.
- Waiting: Waiting for a particular event or resource.
- Terminated: Finished execution or terminated due to an error.

3. Context Switching:
- Saving the current state of a process and restoring the saved state of another process.
- Allows for the illusion of concurrent execution.

4. Process Creation and Termination:
- Creation: New processes can be created using system calls like fork() or exec().
- Termination: Processes can terminate voluntarily or due to errors or completion of execution.

5. Process Scheduling:
- Determines the order in which processes are allocated CPU time.
- Various scheduling algorithms like FCFS, Round Robin, and Priority Scheduling can be used.

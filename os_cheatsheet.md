[Operating System]

**Introduction**
- Introduction to Operating Systems: Operating systems are software that manage computer hardware and software resources and provide services to applications.
- Kernel Space vs. User Space: Kernel space is the protected part of the operating system where privileged operations and critical functions are executed. User space is where user applications and less critical tasks run.
- Components of an Operating System: Operating systems consist of four main components: processes, memory management, storage management, and I/O handling.

1. Operating Systems:
- Software that manages computer resources and provides services to applications.

2. Kernel Space vs. User Space:
- Kernel Space: Protected part of the operating system for privileged operations and critical functions.
- User Space: Area where user applications and less critical tasks run.

3. Components of an Operating System:
- Processes: Executing programs with their own memory space.
- Memory Management: Allocating and managing memory resources.
- Storage Management: Organizing and managing storage devices and file systems.
- I/O Handling: Managing input and output operations with devices.

**Processes**
- Process Definition: A process is an executing program with its own memory space and resources. It represents an instance of a running program.
- Process States: Processes can be in different states, including running, ready, waiting, and terminated, based on their execution status and resource availability.
- Context Switching: Context switching is the mechanism of saving the current state of a process and restoring the saved state of another process for seamless execution.
- Process Creation and Termination: New processes can be created using system calls like fork() or exec(). Processes can terminate voluntarily or due to errors or completion of execution.
- Process Scheduling: Process scheduling algorithms determine the order in which processes are allocated CPU time.

1. Process Definition:
- An executing program with its own memory space and resources.

2. Process States:
- Running: Currently executing on the CPU.
- Ready: Waiting to be assigned CPU time.
- Waiting: Waiting for a particular event or resource.
- Terminated: Finished execution or terminated due to an error.

3. Context Switching:
- Saving the current state of a process and restoring the saved state of another process.
- Allows for the illusion of concurrent execution.

4. Process Creation and Termination:
- Creation: New processes can be created using system calls like fork() or exec().
- Termination: Processes can terminate voluntarily or due to errors or completion of execution.

5. Process Scheduling:
- Determines the order in which processes are allocated CPU time.
- Various scheduling algorithms like FCFS, Round Robin, and Priority Scheduling can be used.

**Interlude: Process API**

- Process API: Process API provides a set of system calls and functions for creating, managing, and communicating between processes.
- Process Creation: Processes can be created using system calls like fork(), which creates a new process as a copy of the existing process.
- Process Termination: Processes can terminate using system calls like exit(), which releases the resources and terminates the process.
- Process Communication: Processes can communicate with each other using various inter-process communication (IPC) mechanisms like pipes, shared memory, and message passing.
- Process Synchronization: Processes can synchronize their activities using synchronization primitives like semaphores and mutexes.


1. Process API:

- Set of system calls and functions for creating, managing, and communicating between processes.

2. Process Creation:

- fork(): Creates a new process as a copy of the existing process.

- Process Termination:

- exit(): Terminates the process and releases the associated resources.

3. Process Communication:

- Pipes: Provides a unidirectional communication channel between processes.
- Shared Memory: Allows multiple processes to access the same memory region.
- Message Passing: Processes exchange messages through a communication mechanism provided by the operating system.

4. Process Synchronization:

- Semaphores: A synchronization primitive that allows processes to coordinate access to shared resources.
- Mutexes: Mutual exclusion locks used to protect critical sections of code.

**Memory Management**

- Memory Management: Memory management is the process of allocating and managing memory resources in an operating system. It involves keeping track of which parts of memory are in use, allocating memory to processes, and reclaiming memory when it is no longer needed.
    
- Address Spaces: Each process has its own virtual address space, which provides an isolated and protected memory environment. The operating system maps the virtual addresses to physical addresses in the physical memory.
    
- Swapping: Swapping is a technique used to temporarily move a process from main memory to secondary storage (such as a hard disk) to free up memory for other processes. It allows for more processes to be executed than can fit in the available physical memory.
    
- Memory Allocation: The operating system must allocate memory to processes as requested. Different allocation strategies can be used, such as fixed partitioning, variable partitioning, or paging.

- Fixed Partitioning:
    Fixed partitioning is a memory allocation technique where the physical memory is divided into fixed-sized partitions or regions. Each partition can accommodate one process. The operating system assigns a process to a partition that is large enough to accommodate it. If a process requires more memory than the available partition size, it cannot be loaded into memory. Fixed partitioning suffers from internal fragmentation, as the allocated memory in a partition may not be fully utilized by a process, resulting in wasted memory.

- Variable Partitioning:
    Variable partitioning is a memory allocation technique where the physical memory is divided into variable-sized partitions or regions. The size of the partitions can vary based on the memory requirements of the processes. When a process needs memory, the operating system searches for a suitable partition that is large enough to accommodate it. Variable partitioning helps to optimize memory usage by allocating memory based on the actual requirements of processes. However, it still suffers from external fragmentation, as free memory blocks become scattered throughout the memory space, making it difficult to allocate larger processes.

- Paging:
    Paging is a memory management technique that divides the logical memory and physical memory into fixed-sized blocks called pages and frames, respectively. The size of a page is typically a power of 2, such as 4KB or 8KB. The logical memory of a process is divided into pages, and the physical memory is divided into frames of the same size. The operating system maps pages to frames, allowing for non-contiguous allocation of memory. Paging eliminates external fragmentation and enables efficient memory allocation. When a process needs to access a page that is not currently in memory, a page fault occurs, and the required page is loaded from secondary storage (e.g., disk) into an available frame in memory.

Paging allows for more efficient memory management and allows processes to be larger than the available physical memory. It also enables the use of virtual memory, where the logical address space of a process can exceed the physical memory size. 

- Fragmentation: Fragmentation refers to the inefficient use of memory due to small gaps or unused memory blocks. It can be external fragmentation (unallocated gaps between allocated memory blocks) or internal fragmentation (unused memory within an allocated block).
    
- Demand Paging: Demand paging is a memory management technique where pages of a process are loaded into memory only when they are accessed, rather than loading the entire process into memory at once. It helps reduce memory usage and improves overall system performance.
